# Never Gonna Give You Up

## Verse 1

[G] We're no strangers to [A] love

[G] You know the rules and [A] so do I

[G] A full commitment's what I'm [A] thinking of

[G] You wouldn't get this from [A] any other guy

[G] I just wanna [A] tell you how I'm feeling

[G] Gotta make you [A] understand
 
## Chorus

Never gonna [G] give you [A] up

Never gonna [F#m] let you [Bm] down

Never gonna [G] run a- [A] round and de- [F#] sert you [Bm]

Never gonna [G] make you [A] cry

Never gonna [F#m] say good- [Bm] bye

Never gonna [G] tell a [A] lie and [F#] hurt you [Bm]

## Verse 2

[G] We've known each other [A] for so long

[G] Your heart's been aching but [A] you're too shy to say it

[G] Inside we both know what's been [A] going on

[G] We know the game and we're [A] gonna play it

[G] And if you [A] ask me how I'm feeling

[G] Don't tell me you're too [A] blind to see
 
## Chorus

Never gonna [G] give you [A] up

Never gonna [F#m] let you [Bm] down

Never gonna [F#m] say good- [Bm] bye

Never gonna [G] tell a [A] lie and [F#] hurt you [Bm]

## Verse 1
[G#6] How was I to know that this was al- [G#addb13] -ways only just a little [Bbm7] game to you? [Eb9], [Bbm7] - [Eb9]

[Bbm7] All the time I felt you gave your [Eb9] heart I thought that I would do the [G#6] same for you,

[Ebm7] Tell the truth I think I should have [G#9] seen it coming from a [C#maj7] mile away,

When the [C#dim] words you say are,

[G#6] "Baby I'm a [F#6] fool who thinks it's [C#mMaj7] cool to fall in [G#6] love."

## Verse 2
[G#6] If I gave a thought to fascina- [G#addb13] -tion I would know it wasn't [Bbm7] right to care, [Bbm7] - [Eb9]

[Bbm7] Logic doesn't seem to mind that [Eb9] I am fascinated by a [G#6] love affair,

[Ebm7] Still my heart would benefit [G#9] from a little tenderness from [C#maj7] time to time,

but [C#dim] never mind, cause

[G#6] Baby I'm a [F#6] fool who thinks it's [C#mMaj7] cool to fall in [G#6] love.

## Verse 3
[G#6] Maybe I should hold on just a mo- [G#addb13] -ment and be sure it's not for [Bbm7] vanity, [Eb9], [Bbm7] - [Eb9]

[Bbm7] Look me in the eye and tell me [Eb9] love is never based upon in- [G#6] -sanity,

[Ebm7] Hear the way my heart is beating [G#9] hurry up the mo- [C#maj7] -ment's fleeting,

Kiss me now, Don't [C#dim] ask me how, cause

[G#6] Baby I'm a [F#6] fool who thinks it's [C#mMaj7] cool to fall,

[G#6] Baby I'm a [F#6] fool who thinks it's [C#mMaj7] cool to fall,

And [G#6] I would never [F#6] tell if you be- [C#mMaj7] -came a fool and fell in [G#6] love.

[A] Come bowling Caroline,

Will come bowling with [A] me.

## Chorus 2

[A] Come bowling Caroline,

[A] Roll my heart down the [D] center line,

[E] Show the world you got the perfect game,

And with a [E7] girl like you [B7]

I'm an open [A] frame.

## Verse 1

[C#m] Little Linda never throws a gutter ball.

[D] Ronnie can't relax 'cause he's [C#7] here with Paul.

[C#m] Holly got so high she hit the [D] ceiling fan,

She'll [B7] never learn to bowl like other [E7] people can.

[C#m] Rita and Ram√≥n are getting wrecked again,

[D] Everybody says they're a [C#7] 7-10.

They [B7] only came to get away from [E7] Shirley's wife.

## Chorus 3

So [A] come bowling Caroline,

[A] Make me stop and wonder if you're [D] gonna be mine.

Cause [E] I can't wait until it's true,

That a [E7] boy like me [B7]

Can come bowling with [A] you.

## Verse 3

[C#m] Danny's digging deep, he's gonna bare his soul,

[D] Tell us all of life's just a [C#7] ten-pin bowl.

I [B7] went ahead and booked it for my [E7] Caroline.

## Chorus 4

So come bowling [A] Caroline,

[A] It may be infantile and [D] asinine,

But [E] all our friends are saying what the hell, [E7]

Caro- [B7] line

Should be here as [A] well.

## Verse 4

[C#m] Never gonna say that I'm the best for you,

[D] We got troubled hearts like [C#7] people do.

But [C#m] Caroline, you know that my [D] love stands tall,

[B7] After every one of these [E7] skittles fall.

## Chorus 5

[A] So come bowling Caroline,

[A] Come out tonight with these [D] friends of mine,

Cause [E] I can't wait until they see,

That a [E7] girl like you [B7]

Will come bowling with [A] me.

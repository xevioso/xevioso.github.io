# Hungry Heart

## Verse 1
[G] Got a wife and kids in [Em7] Baltimore Jack

I went [Am7] out for a ride and I [C] never went back

Like a [G] river that don't know where it's [Em7] flowing

I [Am7] took a wrong turn and I just [C] kept on going

## Chorus

[G] Everybody's got a [Em7] hungry heart

[Am7] Everybody's got a [C] hungry heart

[G] Lay down your money and you [Em7] play your part

Every- [Am7] body's got a huh-uh- [C] un-gry heart

## Verse 2

I met her in a Kingstown bar

We fell in love I knew it had to end

We took what we had and we ripped it apart

Now here I am down in Kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry heart

Everybody's got a hungry heart

Lay down your money and you play your part

Everybody's got a huh-uh-un-gry heart



(rest of song continues just like the verses before it)


[Verse 3]

Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

Everybody's got a hungry heart...

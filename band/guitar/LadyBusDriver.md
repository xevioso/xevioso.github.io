# Lady Bus Driver

## Verse 1

Lady Bus Driver, drive me out of this town,

If I stay at this stop, I'm gonna break down.

I left my baby, now I'm falling apart,

Feel like a bus drove over my heart.

## Verse 2

I'd bring her back again, that's what I'd do,

If I could drive away on wheels like you.

You gotta hear me, Lady Bus Driver,

I never miss your bus, but I do miss her.

## Chorus 1

Whoa-oh,

She could be anywhere,

My baby could be anywhere,

Whoa-oh,

Lady Bus Driver,

Don't you even care?

## Verse 3

She could be in Jakarta, now, or New Orleans.

Could be Tahiti or in Glendale, Queens,

Tegucigalpa or Delaware,

Lady Bus Driver, won't you drive us there?

## Verse 4

I left my baby and she went away,

Up to Tbilisi or down to Santa Fe.

She could be flying out to Fujian,

Lady Bus Driver, say, what's the plan?

## Chorus 2

Whoa-oh,

I tore our love apart,

And now my tears start,

Whoa-oh,

Lady Bus Driver,

Ain't it breaking your heart?

## Verse 5

She could be all alone in Rejkavik,

I left my baby and I'm worried sick.

Maybe she found a job in Cura√ßao,

Lady Bus Driver, can't we leave right now?

## Verse 6

They have volcanoes all across Japan,

Big mafiosi running round Milan.

If she's in Bali learning Balinese,

Lady Bus Driver, won't you fetch her please?

## Chorus 3

Whoa-oh,

She could be anywhere,

My baby could be anywhere,

Whoa-oh,

Lady Bus Driver,

Won't you drive us both there?

## Outro

She could be anywhere,

My baby could be anywhere...

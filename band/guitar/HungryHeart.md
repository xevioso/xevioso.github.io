# Hungry Heart

## Verse 1

[G] Got a wife and kids in [Em7] Baltimore Jack

I went [Am7] out for a ride and I [C] never went back

Like a [G] river that don't know where it's [Em7] flowing

I [Am7] took a wrong turn and I just [C] kept on going

## Chorus

Every- [G] body's got a [Em7] hungry heart

[Am7] Everybody's got a [C] hungry heart

[G] Lay down your money and you [Em7] play your part

Every- [Am7] body's got a huh-uh- [C] un-gry heart

## Verse 2

I met her [G] down in a [Em7] Kingstown bar

We fell in [Am7] love I knew it [C] had to end

We [G] took what we had and we [Em7] ripped it apart

Now here I [Am7] am down in Kings- [C] town again

## Chorus

Where every- [G] body's got a [Em7] hungry heart

[Am7] Everybody's got a [C] hungry heart

[G] Lay down your money and you [Em7] play your part

Every- [Am7] body's got a huh-uh- [C] un-gry heart

## Verse 3

Every- [G] body needs a [Em7] place to rest

Every- [Am7] body wants to [C] have a home

Don't make no [G] difference what [Em7] nobody says

Ain't no- [Am7] body like to [C] be alone

## Chorus

Every- [G] body's got a [Em7] hungry heart

[Am7] Everybody's got a [C] hungry heart

[G] Lay down your money and you [Em7] play your part

Every- [Am7] body's got a huh-uh- [C] un-gry heart

## Verse 1

Well, this [G] town has shut [G/F#] down way too 

[Em] early and there's [C9] nothing to [G] do,

So I'm [G] driving a- [G/F#] round in

[Em] circles and I'm [C9] thinkin' 'bout [G] you,

[D] I heard you [D#dim] got yourself a [Em] new last [C9] name, 

[D] Sure didn't [D#dim] think that would [Em] hit me this [C9] way 

And the [G] radio [G/F#] just keeps on

[Em] playin' all these [C9] songs about [G] rain

## Verse 2

Now there's [G] all kinds of [G/F#] songs about  

[Em] babies and [C9] love that goes [G] right,

But for [G] some unknown [G/F#] reason no-

[Em] body wants to [C9] play them to- [G] night,

[D] Hey, I hope it's [D#dim] sunny wher- [Em] ever you [C9] are,

But that's [D] sure not the [D#dim] picture to- [Em] night in my [C9] car 

And it [G] sure ain't [G/F#] easing my

[Am] pain, all these [D] songs like

## Chorus

[G] Rainy Night In Georgia and [Bm] Kentucky Rain,

[C9] Here Comes That Rainy Day [G] Feeling Again,

[G] Blue Eyes Cryin' In The [Bm] Early Mornin' Rain,

They [C] go on and on and there's [A] no two the same,

Oh [Am] it would be easy to [D] blame all these songs about [G] rain

[G] - [G/F#] - [Em] - [C9]


## Verse 3

Well, I thought I was over you but I 

guess maybe I'm not,

Cause when I let you go looks like 

lonely is all that I've got,

Guess I'll never know what could have 

been, sure ain't helpin' this mood 

that I'm in,

If they're gonna keep on playin' me songs like,

## Chorus

[G] Rainy Night In Georgia and [Bm] Kentucky Rain,

[C9] Here Comes That Rainy Day [G] Feeling Again,

[G] Blue Eyes Cryin' In The [Bm] Early Mornin' Rain,

They [C] go on and on and there's [A] no two the same,

Oh [Am] it would be easy to [D] blame all these songs about [G] rain

[G] - [G/F#] - [Em] - [C9]

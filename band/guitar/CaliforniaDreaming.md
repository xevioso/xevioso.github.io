## Verse 1

All the leaves are [Am] brown  [G]  [F]

and the [G] sky is [Esus4] gray  [E] 

I've been for a [F] walk  [C]  [Am]

on a [F] winter's [Esus4] day  [E]

I'd be safe and [Am] warm  [G]  [F]

if I [G] was in L. [Esus4] A.  [E]  [E7]

California [Am] dreamin'  [G]   [F]

on such a [Am] winter's [Esus4] day  [E]

## Verse 2

Stopped in to a [Am] church  [G]  [F]

I passed a [G] long the [Esus4] way  [E]                                

Well I [F] got down [C] on my [Am] knees

and I pre- [F] tend to [Esus4]  pray  [E]

You know the preacher likes the [Am] cold  [G]  [F]

He knows I'm [G] gonna [Esus4] stay  [E]  [E7]

California [Am] dreamin' [G]   [F]

on such a [Am] winter's [Esus4] day  [E]                         


## Verse 3
All the leaves are [Am] brown  [G]  [F]

and the [G] sky is [Esus4] gray  [E]  [F] 

I've been for a [F] walk  [C]  [Am]

on a [F] winter's [Esus4] day  [E]

If I didn't [Am] tell her  [G]  [F]

I could [G] leave to- [Esus4] day.  [E]  [E7]

California [Am] dreamin'  [G]   [F]

on such a [Am] winter's [Esus4] day  [E]

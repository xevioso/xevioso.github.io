# Body Clock

## Chant 1

A Dmaj7 E7 A

A D Esus4 E A

I love you baby, but you seem real low,

Tell me, where did our mojo go?

If you're losing heart right now,

We gotta kick start life somehow.

## Verse 1

So let's [A] quit our jobs, buy a [Amaj7] surfboard each,

[A7] Spend a year swimming off [D] Bondi Beach.

[D] Sky dive together with [C#m7] no jumpsuit,

[Bm7] Make love under a [E7] parachute.

She said [A] no no, [E] - [D]

She said I [A] won't go. [D] - [B7]

## Verse 2

I said don't let's sit here getting stale,

We could circle the world by river and rail,

Swim the Nile butterfly stroke,

Watch the stars through campfire smoke.

She said no no,

She said I won't go.

## Chorus 1

[A] Why're you broody, [Bm7] what's the mood?

[F#m7] Baby please don't [A] say we're screwed,

Come [D] on, come [D7] on, come [E] on...

She said [A] Body Clock,

Body Clock,

Aw now, Body Clock.


## Chant 2

When the Body Clock comes & says tick tock,

Your baby's in a hurry and you're in shock,

Do not hide, do not run,

Body Clock waits for no one.

## Verse 3

Learn piano, start a band,

Dance all night in Dixieland,

Scuba on down to the Caribbean,

Be everything we dreamed of being,

She said no no,

She said I can't go.

## Verse 4

Write that novel, run that run,

Live life like it's your only one.

Do not waste the time that flies,

Go collect that Nobel Prize.

She said no no,

I don't think so.

## Chorus 2

From the start you were my only one,

You got a wild side & a sense of fun,

So come on, come on, come on...

And now a Body Clock,

You got Body Clock,

Aw now, Body Clock.

## Chant 3

When the Body Clock comes, says ding ding,

Your baby can't think about one more thing,

Taking care of you done lost its spark,

Your baby needs to be a matriarch.

## Verse 5

So let's quit our jobs, surrender to fate,

Go climb a tree and meditate.

Love the world the best we can,

Or do you think you got a better plan?

She said yes yes,

I'll give you one guess.

## Chorus 3

I was real worried until I saw,

She only wants the two of us to be one more,

So come on, come on, come on...

We said Body Clock,

Body Clock,

Aw now, Body Clock.

## Chant 4

When the Body Clock comes, says tick tock,

Your baby's in a hurry and you're in shock,

You cannot hide, you cannot run,

Body Clock waits for no one.

## Outro

She said Body Clock,

Body Clock,

Aw now, Body Clock,

She said Body Clock.

# Lady Bus Driver

## Verse 1

Lady Bus Driver, drive me out of this town,

If I stay at this stop, I'm gonna break down.

I left my baby, now I'm falling apart,

Feel like a bus drove over my heart.

## Verse 2

I'd bring her back again, that's what I'd do,

If I could drive away on wheels like you.

You gotta hear me, Lady Bus Driver,

I never miss your bus, but I do miss her.

## Chorus 1

Whoa-oh,

She could be anywhere,

My baby could be anywhere,

Whoa-oh,

Lady Bus Driver,

Don't you even care?

She could' be in Jakar'ta, now, or New' Orleans'.
Could' be' Tahi'ti or in Glen'dale, Queens',
Tegu'cigal'pa or Del'aware',
Lady' Bus Dri'ver, won't you drive' us there'?

I left' my ba'by and she went' away',
Up' to Tbili'si or down' to San'ta Fe.
She' could' be fly'ing out' to Fujian',
Lady' Bus Dri'ver, say, what's' the plan'?

Whoa'-oh'
I tore our love apart
And now my tears start
Whoa'-oh'
La'dy Bus' Driver'
Ain't' it break'ing your heart'?

She could be all alone in Rejkavik,
I left my baby and I'm worried sick.
Maybe she found a job in Cura√ßao,
Lady' Bus Dri'ver, can't we leave' right now'?

They have volcanoes all across Japan,
Big mafiosi running round Milan.
If she's in Bali learning Balinese,
Lady Bus Driver, won't you fetch her please?

Whoa'-oh'
She could' be an'ywhere
My ba'by could' be an'ywhere
Whoa'-oh'
La'dy Bus' Driver'
Won't' you drive' us both there'?

She could' be an'ywhere
My ba'by could' be an'ywhere...

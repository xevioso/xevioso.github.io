And I was [E] on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham, smokin' into New Or- [A] leans.

[A]  Somebody helped me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston [D] Town.

There are [E] people there who care a little about me,

and they won't let the poor boy [A] down. Take it!

## Verse 3

And I [E] woke up high over Albuquerque, on a jet to the promised [A] land.

[A] Working on a T-bone steak a la carte, flyin' over to the golden [D] state.

Ah when the [E] pilot told us in thirteen minutes he would set us at the terminal [A] gate.
